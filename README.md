Learning is a motto.
After following various profiles and roadmaps of different careers, finally, I understood my passion towards data, exploring information and making insights with proof, i.e. (data). 
Hence currently learning in depth about Data Science and looking for internships to gain some practical experience by playing with real-life data.
